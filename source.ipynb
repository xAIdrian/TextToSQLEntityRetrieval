The IMSI is used by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) and is an important part of the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) profile.;ifc.CDR.interceptionCriteria: Criteria for intercepting the communication;ifc.CDR.interceptionFilter: Filter applied for interception;ifc.ootb.CDR.ipAddress: IP address of the communication's  Origin ;ifc.ootb.CDR.isAttachment: Indicates if the communication has an attachment;ifc.CDR.isClassified: Indicates if the communication is classified;ifc.ootb.CDR.msisdn: MSISDN or phone number is the phone number associated with a mobile network subscriber as a sender. It is the globally unique number that identifies a subscriber's subscription in a mobile network, allowing them to make calls, send SMS, and utilize mobile data as sender.Purpose: The primary purpose of an MSISDN is to identify the subscriber's phone number for routing calls and messages. It is tied to the SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) used in the mobile device.Components: An MSISDN includes the country code (CC), the national destination code (NDC), and the subscriber number (SN).;ifc.ootb.CDR.msisdn2: MSISDN or phone number is the phone number associated with a mobile network subscriber as a receiver. It is the globally unique number that identifies a subscriber's subscription in a mobile network, allowing them to receive calls, receive SMS, and utilize mobile data as reciever.Purpose: The primary purpose of an MSISDN is to identify the subscriber's phone number for routing calls and messages. It is tied to the SIM card (Subscriber Identity Module) used in the mobile device.Components: An MSISDN includes the country code (CC), the national destination code (NDC), and the subscriber number (SN).;ifc.ootb.CDR.protocol: Communication protocol used like GSM or UMTS;ifc.ootb.CDR.provider: Provider of the network service;ifc.ootb.CDR.smsProtocol: Protocol used for SMS communication;ifc.ootb.CDR.smsText: Text content of the SMS;ifc.ootb.CDR.smsType: Type of the SMS (e.g., text, binary);ifc.ootb.CDR.startTime: Time when the communication started;ifc.CDR.subcaseCode: Code for the subcase of a known case. Identify between this field and the ifc.CDR.caseCode;ifc.CDR.targetCode: Code identifying the target of the communication;ifc.ootb.CDR.technology: Technology used in the communication, either: 2G,3G,4G,5G,other, WiFi;ifc.ootb.CDR.type: Type of the communication, either: None-Call, Text,Voice, VoiceEdited, Web or Email. Text type is SMS, Voice type is Phone Calls;ifc.ootb.CDR.mainLanguage: Primary language of the communication content;ifc.ootb.CDR.ipAddress2: IP address of the communication's  Destination;ifc.ootb.CDR.originatorEmailAddress: Email address of the sender;ifc.ootb.CDR.destinationEmailAddress: Email address of the recipient;ifc.ootb.CDR.orignatorNetworkName: Name of the originator's network;ifc.ootb.CDR.destinatorNetworkName: Name of the recipient's network\n",
