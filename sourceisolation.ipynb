    "- Depenencies and file loading\n",
    "- Getting familiar with data\n",
    "- Data preparation. This involves mapping the entity type to fields and combining the user query with the field description. (field_Description provides the semantic context to get the correct json prop)\n",
    "- JSON cleaning and error handling\n",
    "- We then label the data using the json entities extracted to provide more context to the data.\n",
    "- Map dictionairies to dataset (this will change)\n",
    "- Training / validation split\n",
    "- Saving dataset locally\n",
    "- Loading or training the a new model\n",
    "- Save the model and tokenizer locally\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "- Inference\n",

    "\n",
    "To improve our output I'd like to get clear on what quality outputs look like and discuss the data architecture and the relations between all the features. I'd also like to see more example outputs to get a better sense of the model's desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's clearly break down the relation between the user query and the fields.  I want to hear it entirely from your perspective?\n",
    "- We want to predict BOTH the entity type and the relation target type?\n",
    "- What do you consider a good output here for the prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's left to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test cases aligned with the examples you'd like to see\n",
    "- Clean up the notebook and add comments\n",
    "- Look into ways to get a bit more realistic accuracy of the model\n",
    "- Allow for a new CSV to be uploaded in markdown Ui in notebook and assigned to a path variable that is processed in data step\n",
    "- Simplify model training configuration make sure everything is optimized to be run on the local machine and using steps, not a mix of steps and epochs.\n",
    "- Optimized local storage and defensive code to conserve resources and make sure we save and load properly\n",
    "- TEST CASES\n"
