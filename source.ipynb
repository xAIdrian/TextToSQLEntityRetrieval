    "- Depenencies and file loading\n",
    "- Getting familiar with data\n",
    "- Data preparation. This involves mapping the entity type to fields and combining the user query with the field description. (field_Description provides the semantic context to get the correct json prop)\n",
    "- JSON cleaning and error handling\n",
    "- We then label the data using the json entities extracted to provide more context to the data.\n",
    "- Map dictionairies to dataset (this will change)\n",
    "- Training / validation split\n",
    "- Saving dataset locally\n",
    "- Loading or training the a new model\n",
    "- Save the model and tokenizer locally\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "- Inference\n",

    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's clearly break down the relation between the user query and the fields.  I want to hear it entirely from your perspective?\n",
    "- We want to predict BOTH the entity type and the relation target type?\n",
    "- What do you consider a good output here for the prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's left to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Test cases aligned with the examples you'd like to see\n",
    "- Clean up the notebook and add comments\n",
    "- Look into ways to get a bit more realistic accuracy of the model\n",
    "- Allow for a new CSV to be uploaded in markdown Ui in notebook and assigned to a path variable that is processed in data step\n",
    "- Simplify model training configuration make sure everything is optimized to be run on the local machine and using steps, not a mix of steps and epochs.\n",
    "- Optimized local storage and defensive code to conserve resources and make sure we save and load properly\n",
